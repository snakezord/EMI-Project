1. Generate INPUTS with gen.py:
    This script generate different input directories.
    Customize:
        N_INPUT_FOLDERS = 10    //Number of input folders   
        N_INPUTS_MAX = 10000    //Maximum number of elements in array
        n = 100                 //starting number of elements in array
                                //More info in file
    Run: python gen.py

2. Send those INPUT files to existing Algorithms using the bash script input_read.command:
    This script go threw every generated input and send it to every existing algorithm, after, creating the necessary Data.
    It creates directories and subdirectories for every algorithm and probability with corresponding output folder for every given input folder.  
    Customize:
        PROBABILITY_VARIATION=0.1 //Incremental probability constant
        PROBABILITY_MAX=0.95      //maximum probability value
    Run: ./input_read.command

3. Analyse and generate graphs with generated Data using graphs.py
